New chess engine in C++.

This is my very first full-fledged chess engine in C++. As an intermediate level chess player, I wanted to try to build a chess engine from scratch. 

This chess engine uses bitboards, in which our board is stored as an unsigned 64-bit integer. 

I'd like to give credit to the Chess Programming Wiki in explaining all these new concepts such as attack maps, bitboards, and magics, as well as the YouTube Channel Chess Programming, whose Bitboard Chess Engine in C playlist was a monumental help for me in getting started and learning about bitboards.
